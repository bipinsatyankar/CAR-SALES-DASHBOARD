### Introduction

This dashboard presents an analysis of car sales, focusing on various metrics such as the most used car brands, the distance traveled by different brands based on the number of seats, average car selling prices over the years, and fuel usage trends from 1994 to 2022. The data offers insights into consumer preferences, market trends, and the evolution of fuel usage over nearly three decades.

### Insights

1. **Most Used Car Brands:**
   - The pie chart highlights that Mahindra is the most used car brand among the data set, followed by Chevrolet, Honda, and Ford. This indicates that Mahindra holds a significant market share in the analyzed data.

2. **Distance Traveled by Brands vs. Number of Seats:**
   - The bar chart shows that vehicles from Mahindra have traveled the most distance compared to other brands, particularly in the category with 7 seats. Chevrolet and Tata also show high mileage, especially in the 4-seater category. This could suggest that these brands are popular among users who travel long distances, possibly due to their reliability and fuel efficiency.

3. **Average Car Selling Prices by Brand (2016-2022):**
   - The average selling price varies significantly across brands, with some notable spikes. For instance, in 2016, a significant spike in the average selling price is seen for one brand, possibly indicating the introduction of a high-end model or a market anomaly. Over the years, there seems to be a general trend of price stability with minor fluctuations.

4. **Fuel Usage Trends Over the Years (1994-2022):**
   - The line graph shows that diesel and petrol were the most commonly used fuels, with diesel peaking around 2015. However, there is a noticeable decline in diesel usage after 2016, possibly due to increased environmental concerns and a shift towards more sustainable alternatives. CNG and LPG show lesser usage but remain consistent over the years.

### Conclusion

The dashboard provides valuable insights into car sales and usage trends. Mahindra emerges as a dominant brand in terms of usage and distance traveled. The selling prices of cars have shown fluctuations, possibly reflecting market dynamics and consumer preferences. Finally, the fuel usage trends reveal a shift away from diesel towards alternative fuels, which aligns with global movements toward sustainability. This dashboard serves as a useful tool for understanding car market trends and can help stakeholders make informed decisions.
